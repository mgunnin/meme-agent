## Fixing TypeScript 'unknown' Type Error (1/12/2025, 2:23:49 PM)

For the code present, we get this error:
```
'authData' is of type 'unknown'.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

The error occurs because TypeScript doesn't know the shape of the data returned from `json()`. Here's how to fix it by adding type safety:

```typescript:src/services/social/auth/twitterAuth.ts
      // Handle potential two-factor or additional verification steps
      const authData = await authResponse.json() as { requires_verification?: boolean }
      if (authData.requires_verification) {
        throw new TwitterAuthError(
          "Two-factor authentication is required but not supported"
        )
      }
```

This adds a type assertion to specify the expected shape of the authentication response data. Alternatively, you could define an interface if you need to use this type in multiple places.

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Could not find a declaration file for module 'qs'. '/Users/mgunnin/Developer/meme-agent/node_modules/.pnpm/qs@6.13.1/node_modules/qs/lib/index.js' implicitly has an 'any' type.
  If the 'qs' package actually exposes this module, consider sending a pull request to amend 'https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/master/types/qs'
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

You need to install the type definitions for the `qs` package. Run this command:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @types/qs
```

Or if you're using pnpm:

```bash
pnpm add -D @types/qs
```

This will add the TypeScript type definitions for the `qs` package and resolve the error.

I don't see any actual linter errors in the output. However, I notice you're using `ParsedQs` from the `qs` package. A more modern approach would be to use Express's built-in types. Here's how to update the imports and types:

```typescript:src/middleware/validation.ts
import { NextFunction, Request, Response, Query } from "express"
import { ParamsDictionary } from "express-serve-static-core"
import { ZodSchema, z } from "zod"
import { AppError } from "./error.js"

interface ValidatedRequest<T> {
  body: T
  query: Query
  params: ParamsDictionary
}
```

This removes the dependency on the `qs` package and uses Express's native typing instead. The rest of the file can remain unchanged.

Install the Express type definitions:

```bash
pnpm add -D @types/express
```

This will provide the necessary type declarations for `express-serve-static-core` since it's included in the Express type definitions package.

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the context, let's use the correct import path from Express. Here's the fix:

```typescript:src/middleware/validation.ts
import { NextFunction, Request, Response } from "express"
import type { ParamsDictionary } from "express-serve-static-core"
import { ParsedQs } from "qs"
import { ZodSchema, z } from "zod"
import { AppError } from "./error.js"
```

The key change is adding `type` before the import from `express-serve-static-core`. This ensures we're only importing the type definition, which should be available through the `@types/express` package we installed earlier.

If you're still seeing the error after this change, verify that `@types/express` is listed in your `devDependencies` in package.json. If not, install it with:

```bash
pnpm add -D @types/express
```

Let's add a type for the Jupiter price API response:

```typescript:src/services/blockchain/trading.ts
      const response = await fetch(
        `https://price.jup.ag/v4/price?ids=${tokenAddress}`
      )
      interface JupiterPriceResponse {
        data: Record<string, { price: number }>
      }
      const data = await response.json() as JupiterPriceResponse
      return data.data[tokenAddress]?.price || 0
```

This adds type safety to the JSON response from Jupiter's price API.

For the code present, we get this error:

Add a type for the Pinata API response:

```typescript:src/services/blockchain/pump.ts
  const ipfsResponse = await fetch("https://uploads.pinata.cloud/v3/files", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${JWT}`,
    },
    body: formData,
  })
  interface PinataResponse {
    IpfsHash: string
  }
  const ipfsData = (await ipfsResponse.json()) as PinataResponse
  const ipfsCid = ipfsData.IpfsHash
```

This adds type safety to the Pinata IPFS upload response.

Looking at the code, we should also add error handling and logging for the IPFS response. Here's the improved version:

```typescript:src/services/blockchain/pump.ts
  const ipfsResponse = await fetch("https://uploads.pinata.cloud/v3/files", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${JWT}`,
    },
    body: formData,
  })

  if (!ipfsResponse.ok) {
    throw new Error(`IPFS upload failed: ${ipfsResponse.statusText}`)
  }

  interface PinataResponse {
    IpfsHash: string
  }
  const ipfsData = (await ipfsResponse.json()) as PinataResponse
  console.log("IPFS Upload Response:", { ipfsHash: ipfsData.IpfsHash })
  const ipfsCid = ipfsData.IpfsHash
```

This adds proper error handling for the IPFS upload and structured logging while maintaining type safety.

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Cannot find module 'form-data' or its corresponding type declarations.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

Install the type definitions for form-data:

```bash
pnpm add -D @types/form-data
```

This will add the necessary TypeScript type declarations for the form-data package.

I notice there are no actual linter errors shown, but looking at the code, we should properly type the response from the trade-local API. Here's how to improve the typing in the pump.ts file:

```typescript:src/services/blockchain/pump.ts
  // Get the create transaction
  interface TradeResponse {
    status: number
    statusText: string
    arrayBuffer(): Promise<ArrayBuffer>
  }

  const response = await fetch(`https://pumpportal.fun/api/trade-local`, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      publicKey: signerKeyPair.publicKey.toBase58(),
      action: "create",
      tokenMetadata: {
        name: "DemoLLMemecoin",
        symbol: "$DLLM",
        uri: `ipfs://${ipfsCid}`,
      },
      mint: mintKeypair.publicKey.toBase58(),
      denominatedInSol: "true",
      amount: 0,
      slippage: 20,
      priorityFee: 0.0005,
      pool: "pump",
    }),
  }) as TradeResponse

  if (response.status === 200) {
    const data = await response.arrayBuffer()
```

This adds type safety to the trade API response handling. The rest of your code looks good from a typing perspective.
