## Resolving Express Module Type Error (1/12/2025, 2:23:49 PM)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Cannot find module 'express' or its corresponding type declarations.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

This error occurs because the Express types aren't installed. You need to install the type definitions for Express as a dev dependency.

Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @types/express
```

Or if you're using yarn:

```bash
yarn add -D @types/express
```

This will add the TypeScript type definitions for Express without modifying your runtime dependencies.

For the code present, we get this error:
```
'authData' is of type 'unknown'.
```

You need to type the response data. Here's the fix:

```typescript:src/services/social/auth/twitterAuth.ts
// ... existing code ...
      interface TwitterAuthResponse {
        requires_verification: boolean;
      }
      
      const authData = await authResponse.json() as TwitterAuthResponse;
      if (authData.requires_verification) {
        throw new TwitterAuthError('Two-factor authentication is required but not supported');
      }
// ... existing code ...
```

This adds type safety by asserting the shape of the response data using a TypeScript interface.

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Cannot find module 'express-serve-static-core' or its corresponding type declarations.
```

_**Assistant**_



Install the Express types package which includes this dependency:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @types/express-serve-static-core
```

Or with yarn:

```bash
yarn add -D @types/express-serve-static-core
```

Note: Usually installing `@types/express` should be sufficient as it includes this dependency, but if you're still seeing the error, installing it explicitly will resolve it.

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Cannot find module 'cors' or its corresponding type declarations.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_



Install the CORS types package:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @types/cors
```

Or with yarn:

```bash
yarn add -D @types/cors
```

This will add the TypeScript type definitions for the CORS middleware.

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Cannot find module 'form-data' or its corresponding type declarations.
```

_**Assistant**_





Install the Form-Data types package:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @types/form-data
```


Or with yarn:

```bash
yarn add -D @types/form-data
```


This will add the TypeScript type definitions for Form-Data.

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Cannot find module 'form-data' or its corresponding type declarations.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_



First install the form-data package and its types:

```bash
npm install form-data @types/form-data
```

Or with yarn:

```bash
yarn add form-data @types/form-data
```

Then update the import to use the default import syntax:

```typescript:src/services/blockchain/pump.ts
import FormData from 'form-data';
```

---

_**User**_

I did install it using pnpm install @types/form-data -- But its still showing an error in @pump.ts 

---

_**Assistant**_



Try installing both the package and its types:

```bash
pnpm install form-data @types/form-data
```

The error might persist because you need both the actual package and its type definitions. The `@types` package alone isn't sufficient if the main package isn't installed.

Also, make sure your `tsconfig.json` includes `node_modules/@types` in the `typeRoots` if you've customized that setting.
